### RenderWare Version Detection System

The suite includes a comprehensive RenderWare version detection system that provides advanced support for analyzing game files:

#### Supported File Formats
- **DFF (3D Models):** Complete support for all GTA games with section type detection (0x0010 CLUMP)
- **TXD (Texture Dictionaries):** Full RenderWare version extraction with section type detection (0x0016 TEXDICTIONARY)
- **COL (Collision Files):** Support for all COL variants with FourCC signature detection:
  - **COL1:** FourCC 'COLL' (GTA III, Vice City)
  - **COL2:** FourCC 'COL2' (GTA San Andreas)
  - **COL3:** FourCC 'COL3' (GTA SA Advanced)
  - **COL4:** FourCC 'COL4' (Extended format)

#### Game Version Support
- **GTA III:** RenderWare 3.1.0.1 (0x31001)
- **Vice City:** RenderWare 3.3.0.2 (0x33002)
- **San Andreas:** RenderWare 3.6.0.3 (0x36003) / 3.4.0.3 (0x34003)

- **Advanced Filtering:** Filter IMG archives by game version, file format, and COL type
- **Detailed Information:** Enhanced tooltips and version breakdown statistics
- **Error Handling:** Graceful failure handling for corrupted or unknown files

#### Technical Implementation
The system uses a multi-stage detection approach:
1. **COL Files:** FourCC signature detection for collision files
2. **RenderWare Files:** Section type + version analysis for DFF/TXD files
3. **Fallback Detection:** Generic file type identification for unknown formats

All detection logic is centralized in `application/common/rw_versions.py` for consistency across tools, with comprehensive support for both standard RenderWare files and collision formats.

### Theme System

The application features a comprehensive theme system designed to provide a consistent, professional dark theme experience across all platforms and system configurations.

#### Key Features
- **System Independence:** The theme works consistently regardless of OS theme settings (Windows dark/light mode, Linux themes, etc.)
- **Centralized Management:** All colors and styling are managed through the `ModernDarkTheme` class in `styles.py`
- **Palette Override:** Uses Qt's palette system to ensure even system-drawn widgets follow the dark theme
- **No Hardcoded Colors:** All UI components use theme constants for maintainable and consistent styling


### Responsive Design

The application implements a comprehensive responsive design system that ensures optimal user experience across different screen sizes and DPI settings.

#### Responsive Manager
The `get_responsive_manager()` provides centralized responsive utilities:
- **DPI Awareness:** Automatically detects and adapts to different DPI settings
- **Screen Size Detection:** Identifies screen size categories (small, medium, large)
- **Scale Factor Calculation:** Provides appropriate scaling for UI elements
- **Breakpoint System:** Responsive breakpoints for different layout arrangements

#### Key Features
- **Font Scaling:** Automatic font size adjustment based on screen DPI and user preferences
- **Spacing Management:** Consistent spacing that scales appropriately across different screens
- **Component Sizing:** Buttons, panels, and other components adapt to screen size
- **Layout Adaptation:** UI layouts adjust for optimal space usage on different screen sizes

#### Usage Example
```python
from application.responsive_utils import get_responsive_manager

rm = get_responsive_manager()
fonts = rm.get_font_config()
spacing = rm.get_spacing_config()

# Apply responsive sizing
label.setStyleSheet(f"font-size: {fonts['header']['size']}px;")
layout.setContentsMargins(spacing['medium'], spacing['small'], spacing['medium'], spacing['small'])
```

#### Usage Examples

**Basic Version Detection:**
```python
from application.common.rw_versions import detect_rw_file_format

# Detect file format and version from binary data
file_format, version_desc, version_num = detect_rw_file_format(data, "model.dff")
print(f"Format: {file_format}, Version: {version_desc}")
# Output: Format: DFF, Version: DFF (3.6.0.3)
```

**COL File Detection:**
```python
from application.common.rw_versions import get_col_version_info

# Analyze COL collision files
version_name, version_num = get_col_version_info(col_data)
print(f"COL Version: {version_name}")
# Output: COL Version: COL2 (GTA SA)
```

**IMG Archive Analysis:**
```python
# Automatic version analysis when loading IMG files in the editor
archive.analyze_all_entries_rw_versions()
summary = archive.get_rw_version_summary()
print(f"RenderWare files: {summary['renderware_files']}")
```

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the Renderware Modding Suite up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8 or higher** (Python 3.9+ recommended for optimal performance)
- **Git** (for cloning the repository)
- **Operating System:** Windows 10/11, macOS 10.14+, or Linux (Ubuntu 18.04+)
- **Memory:** At least 4GB RAM (8GB recommended for large archive operations)
- **Display:** Minimum 1280x720 resolution (application is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/GTA-Renderware-Modding-Suite.git
    cd GTA-Renderware-Modding-Suite
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```sh
    # For Windows
    python -m venv .venv
    .venv\Scripts\activate

    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required packages:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

**Note:** For building standalone executables, you can use the included build script:
```sh
python build.py
```

### Running the Application

Once the installation is complete, you can run the application with the following command:

```sh
python -m application.main
```

The application will start with:
- **Welcome Screen:** Initial interface with tool selection
- **Memory Monitoring:** Real-time memory usage display in status bar
- **Responsive UI:** Automatically adapted to your screen size and DPI
- **Debug Logging:** Comprehensive logging to terminal and log files
- **Menu System:** Full menu bar with keyboard shortcuts and zoom controls

## Building from Source

You can create a standalone executable of the application using the included build system.

### Using the Build Script

The project includes a comprehensive build script (`build.py`) that handles the entire build process:

```sh
python build.py
```

This script will:
- Install build dependencies (Nuitka)
- Create an optimized executable with all required files
- Generate a standalone distribution in the `build/` directory

### Manual Nuitka Build

Alternatively, you can use Nuitka manually for building:

1.  **Install Nuitka:**
    ```sh
    pip install nuitka
    ```

2.  **Build the executable:**
    ```sh
    nuitka --standalone --onefile --enable-plugin=PyQt6,qt-plugins application/main.py
    ```

    The final executable will be located in the `dist/` directory.

### Quick Start for New Tools

1. Start minimal (look at `RW_Analyze`) or scaffold complexity (like `IMG_Editor`).
2. Separate controller/business logic when operations grow (> single file UI).
3. Use `get_responsive_manager()` for every size/font/spacing decision.
4. Use only `ModernDarkTheme` constants. No hardcoded colors.
5. Add signals for integration (`tool_action`, domain-specific events).
6. Register in `tool_registry.py` with name, description, icon.
7. Use `get_debug_logger()` with categories + performance timers.
8. Provide `cleanup()` for long-lived resources.
9. Test under varying DPI/scale factors (0.8â€“2.0) & resolutions.
10. Document module header (purpose + interactions).
